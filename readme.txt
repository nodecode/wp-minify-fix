[Fixed] This plugin uses the Minify engine to combine and compress JS and CSS files
to improve page load time.

== Description ==
This plugin is a fork of [WP Minify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-minify/) to fix bugs and add features, because it has not been updated since 2012-6-4.

This plugin integrates the [Minify engine](https://github.com/mrclay/minify)
into your WordPress blog.  Once enabled, this plugin will combine and compress
JS and CSS files to improve page load time.

= What has been fixed? =

* Minify engine updated to version 2.1.7
* Cache interval option has been fixed
* Move CSS-@imports to the top of the output
* Bottom CSS- and JavaScript output fixed
* Support for script tags without `type="text/javascript"`
* Detection of protocol-relative URLs as external file (e.g. Google AdSense)
* New option for the HTML5 async attribute
* A separate JavaScript file in the footer is now possible

= How Does it Work? =

WP Minify Fix grabs JS/CSS files in your generated WordPress page and passes that
list to the Minify engine. The Minify engine then returns a consolidated,
minified, and compressed script or style for WP Minify to reference in the
WordPress header.

* Minifies JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
* Debug tools to help you debug your issues.
* Ability to include extra JS and CSS files for Minifying.
* Ability to exclude certain JS and CSS files for Minifying.

* Support for to minifying external files via caching.
